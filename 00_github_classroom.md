# GitHub Classroom  

In this course, you will use GitHub Classroom for sharing code. The two primary ways you will use GitHub classroom for sharing code are for (1) completing interview-style coding exercises, and (2) submitting individual and team assignments. After reading this document, you will know:

## [What Is GitHub Classroom](#what-is-github-classroom)  

GitHub Classroom is an online education tool for developers that allows students and staff to share code, exchange lecture materials, and otherwise communicate about learning how to code. For instance, using GitHub Classroom, ITC can create assignments with or without starter code, share code, instructions and lecture materials with you, track your work, review your code, provide feedback on your work, and more. 

GitHub Classroom has all the tools that professional developers use to store and share code on GitHub. At its core, GitHub is an online version control system. It has many features that professional developers need for saving and managing their code. For instsance, GitHub lets you save your code online as you develop, which helps keep you from losing your work if something happens to your computer. With GitHub, you also can revert back to older drafts, create branches so that you can build and perfect features before adding them to the main project, review and comment on your co-worker's code, and much more. 

GitHub Classroom has the same tools as GitHub, plus it has built-in workflows designed to enhance interactions between students and staff. For instance, ITC can create a coding template for each exersice a student must complete, and GitHub Classroom will use it to create a GitHub Classroom repository for each student based on that coding template. Then, each student can submit their work for that exercise to their repository. 

Another Classroom features is the **Feedback**. For each assignment, after a student submits their work, a staff member can review it and provide in-line feedback in the **Feedback** pull request that Classroom automatically generates. The student can review the in-line feedback and then mark it as complete so that the staff knows.

## [Why Use GitHub Classroom](#why-use-github-classroom)     

At ITC, we use GitHub Classroom for several reasons. We use it mainly to:  

- Prepare you to **become a professional** developer  
- **Share code** between and among students and ITC    
- Track **your progress**  
- **Review code** and offer feedback  

First, GitHub is the most popular version controlling system for developers. By using GitHub Classroom, you learn many of the Github tools you'll need for working as a developer. Later in this course, you'll learn more about GitHub generally, which will build upon what you learn about using GitHub Classroom.

Second, using GitHub Classroom, we can share code with you and you can share code with us. For instance, throughout the course, you will have to complete many interview-style coding exercises. For each interview exercise, we give you code that tests the code you write. We share that testing code with you through GitHub Classroom. You submit your code for each exercise to us through GitHub Classroom.

Throughout the course, you also will have assignments that require you to build a frontend, backend, or fullstack web application by completing certain milestones. For those, you also will submit your work to ITC through GitHub Classroom.  

Third, Github Classroom lets us easily keep track of your work. For each exercise and assignment, Github Classroom generates a repository for each student to store their work. ITC staff can see your repositories and know when and whether you've submitted code. This can help us identify students who are falling behing or speeding ahead!

Fourth, GitHub Classroom makes it easy for us to review your code and provide you feedback. Using tools in the Classroom for receiving feedback will help you practice using GitHub tools generally. For instance, for your individual assignments, we use GitHub Classroom's **Feedback** pull request to comment on your code. You can review our comments right there in the **Feedback** pull request in your GitHub Classroom repository. Be sure to implement the feedback and mark the feedback as completed.
