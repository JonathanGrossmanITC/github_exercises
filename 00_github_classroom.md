# GitHub Classroom  

In this course, you will use GitHub Classroom for sharing code. The two primary ways you will use GitHub classroom for sharing code are for (1) completing interview-style coding exercises, and (2) submitting individual and team assignments. After reading this document, you will know:

At ITC, we use GitHub Classroom for several reasons.

- Prepare you to **become a professional** developer  
- **Share code** between and among students and ITC    
- Track **your progress**  
- **Review code** and offer feedback  

First, GitHub is the most popular version controlling system for developers. By using GitHub Classroom, you learn many of the Github tools you'll need for working as a developer. Later in this course, you'll learn more about GitHub generally, which will build upon what you learn about using GitHub Classroom.

Second, using GitHub Classroom, we can share code with you and you can share code with us. For instance, for each interview exercise, we give you code that tests the code you write. We share that testing code with you through GitHub Classroom. You submit your code for each exercise to us through GitHub Classroom. You also will submit your individual and group assignments through GitHub Classroom. 

Third, Github Classroom lets us easily keep track of your work. For each exercise and assignment, Github Classroom generates a repository for each student to store their work. We can see your repositories and know when and whether you've submitted code. This can help us identify students who are falling behing or speeding ahead!

Fourth, GitHub Classroom makes it easy for us to review your code and provide you feedback. Using tools in the Classroom for receiving feedback will help you practice using GitHub tools generally. For instance, for your individual assignments, we use GitHub Classroom's **Feedback** pull request to comment on your code. You can review our comments right there in the **Feedback** pull request in your GitHub Classroom repository.
